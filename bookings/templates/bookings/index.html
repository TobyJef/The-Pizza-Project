                <p class="text-white-50">
                    Here at the Pizza Project, our aim is to bring together the best
                    locally sourced ingredients and freshly made pizza straight to you and
                    your community, via our bespoke pizza truck.<br />
                    Everything from our hand stretched pizza dough through to our sauce
                    and ingredients are prepared on the day, while the pizza's are
                    assembled and cooked on site, ensuring that we can deliver the
                    freshest slice around.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are available for private hire, corporate functions and
                    charity/community events. For availability and what you
                    <em>KNEAD</em> to know, head over to our booking page.<br />
                    We believe in the power of local community and that charity starts at
                    home. So that is why we donate 5% of our booking fee to local
                    charities within the community. Or we will waive our booking fee if we
                    are used for charitable events.

    <h3>Our Latest Reviews</h3>
    <p>
        ★★★★★ "Wow! We recently had Pizza Project cater our charity
        fundraiser, and they exceeded all our expectations. The pizza was
        delicious, and their team was not only efficient but also incredibly
        friendly. It was a hit with our guests, and we'll definitely be
        inviting them back for our next event!" - Doug<br />
        ★★★★★ "A massive thank you to The Pizza Project for making our company
        picnic a memorable one. The pizzas were a big hit with our employees,
        and the fact that they can accommodate various dietary preferences was
        a lifesaver. Plus, their setup is top-notch, and their team is
        professional and friendly." - Mark F.<br />
        ★★★★★ "I can't express how grateful we are to The Pizza Project for
        their support at our charity event. They provided pizza for over 300
        attendees, and everything ran like clockwork. The guests raved about
        the pizzas, and it truly added a unique and delicious element to our
        event. We highly recommend them for any charitable cause!" - Val<br />
        ★★★★☆ "We booked the Pizza Project for a private garden party, and it
        was a hit with our friends and family. The pizzas were fresh and
        scrumptious, and their mobile setup was a fun and interactive addition
        to the gathering. The only downside was that they ran out of some of
        their pizza slices quite quickly, but it didn't spoil the overall
        experience." - Julie<br />
        ★★★★★ "We had The Pizza Project at our engagement party, and it was a
        brilliant choice. The variety of pizzas they offered catered to all
        our guests' tastes, and their team was accommodating and friendly.
        They helped create a relaxed and enjoyable atmosphere, and everyone
        couldn't stop raving about the pizza." - Barry M.<br />
        ★★★★☆ "We hired The Pizza Projcet for our son's graduation party, and
        the pizzas were a hit with the young crowd. The only reason I'm not
        giving a full five stars is that they could have been a bit more
        responsive during the booking process. However, on the day of the
        event, they delivered on all fronts and made it a memorable
        celebration." - Paul
