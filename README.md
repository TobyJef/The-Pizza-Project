# The Pizza Project

Welcome to The Pizza Project. Our aim is to provide the local and surrounding communities of Bristol with the freshest and highest quality pizza imaginable, outside of Italy or the pizza hotspots of the USA. We craft out pizza sauce and dough every morning, then load up our mobile pizza truck and head out on the open road where we top and cook our pizzas to order on site. Wether that is at your front door, wedding venue, high street or charity event. If we can drive there, we can cook there. Our pizzas are cooked in a wood fired pizza oven in the back of our pizza truck to ensure that authentic pizza experience.

This project, based on a fictitous mobile pizza restaurant of my own deisgn but inspired by a company with a similar business model from the local area of my home town in Bristol. Is designed to allow customers to create and log into an account, and to book The Pizza Project mobile truck on a selected date, and have the option to leave a comment on their booking. As well as for the business owner to log into the website as the super user, to manage their bookings and menu.

## Testing

- Bugs

The first bug I encountered building my project was very early in the development cycle. Luckily, it turned out to be a small error and easily corrected once realised. I was met with an error message when trying to install pyscopg. I first tried to find a solution by reviewing posts in Slack to see if other students had similar issues. I spotted a post from with the same problem, and the reply was to install the binary version of pyscopg. Upon installing that variation and reviewing my own code, it was then I discovered that I had been spelling pyscopg incorrectly, and upon correcting my spelling error the installation proceeded as expected.

I also had an issue when setting up template inheretence for my pages. I had mistakenly placed my url's in double curly brackets instead of one. Which was leading to a parse error when trying to run the pages. After spending longer than I should of reviewing my code with no avail. I reached out to Tutor Assistance, where Holly spotted my error.

## Deployment

## Credit

- Inspiration for The Pizza Project can be attributed to I Scream Tacos. <https://i-scream-tacos.co.uk/> A local mobile food truck based nearby where I live in Bristol, UK. That can be hired to attend local or private events and serve their fresh daily made, traditional Mexican soft shell tacos.

Their business model was used for my project due to it's uniqueness as amethod of serving and delivering quality Mexican food to Bristol and surrounding communities via a second hand repurposed ice cream van. Instead of operating from either a traditional bricks and mortal establishment or a static food trailer, likely to be found within towns and cities, on the roadside or outside sporting/concert venues. By operating out of their taco van they have greater mobility and range than traditional outdoor food vendors which allows them to reach a wider audience.

- Holly from Tutor Assistance for helping my the second bug listed in the above Bugs section. Her quick assistance and observation of where i went wrong and what was needed to correct it was very much appreciated.
