# The Pizza Project

Welcome to The Pizza Project. Our aim is to provide the local and surrounding communities of Bristol with the freshest and highest quality pizza imaginable, outside of Italy or the pizza hotspots of the USA. We craft out pizza sauce and dough every morning, then load up our mobile pizza truck and head out on the open road where we top and cook our pizzas to order on site. Wether that is at your front door, wedding venue, high street or charity event. If we can drive there, we can cook there. Our pizzas are cooked in a wood fired pizza oven in the back of our pizza truck to ensure that authentic pizza experience.

This project, based on a fictitous mobile pizza restaurant of my own deisgn but inspired by a company with a similar business model from the local area of my home town in Bristol. Is designed to allow customers to create and log into an account, and to book The Pizza Project mobile truck on a selected date, and have the option to leave a comment on their booking. As well as for the business owner to log into the website as the super user, to manage their bookings and menu.

## Credit

Inspiration for The Pizza Project can be attributed to I Scream Tacos. <https://i-scream-tacos.co.uk/> A local mobile food truck based nearby where I live in Bristol, UK. That can be hired to attend local or private events and serve their fresh daily made, traditional Mexican soft shell tacos.

Their business model was used for my project due to it's uniqueness as amethod of serving and delivering quality Mexican food to Bristol and surrounding communities via a second hand repurposed ice cream van. Instead of operating from either a traditional bricks and mortal establishment or a static food trailer, likely to be found within towns and cities, on the roadside or outside sporting/concert venues. By operating out of their taco van they have greater mobility and range than traditional outdoor food vendors which allows them to reach a wider audience.
